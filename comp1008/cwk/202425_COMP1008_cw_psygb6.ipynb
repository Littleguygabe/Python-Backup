    "**Continuous Numerical Values**    \n",
    "The data set has continuous numerical values which allows values to be plotted and analysed to create an equation for the line generated from linear regression techniques. This makes it appropriate because linear regression essentially constructs a line with a linear equation to try and plot a relationship between some given attributes, so the more points and the wider range of points that the algorithm is given the more accurately it will be able to generate a line representing the relationship between the given inputs and the selected output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clear Target Values**    \n",
    "By having a clear target value - 'quality' attribute - it means that the system will be able to calculate a 'loss' value to see how good the generated equation is at predecting the relationship between the set of inputs and the output which means that the algorithm can look at the current loss and previous loss to see if it has decreased and if it has then the algorithm knows for the next iteration aswell to shift the regression line further in that direction so that it isn't blindly guessing which way will improve the accuracy of the predicted relationship.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Likely Linear Relation**\n",
    "Lots of the potential input attributes within the dataset are likely to be linearly related meaning there likely exists a linear equation that can plot the overall relationship between the inputs of the wine data set and the outputs. So a linear regression model will be able to pretty accurately predict the relationship aswell as its aim is to try and establish the linear relationship between attributes"

    "**NaN Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Not A Number` values exist within the data set such as within the `density` or the `free sulfur dioxide` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "If pre-processing isn't applied to remove the `NaN` values from the dataset then this could break the model because if an input is `Not a Number` then the formula (equation of the regression line) cannot be used to predicted the output value of an input which would cause the program to crash.1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers Within the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some values within the dataset have extreme values/outliers - such as in the `chlorides` or `sulphates` columns - which can make it harder for the algorithm to develop a linear regression line for the dataset, so these values will need to be identified and then removed from the data set to avoid harming the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If pre-processing isn't properly applied then the outliers can skew the predicted relationship between the inputs and the outputs resulting in inaccurate predictions for a given set of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not Normally Distributed**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the data for attributes such as `residual sugar` have skewed data distributions and linear regression generally assumes that data is normally distributed across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If pre-processing isn't properly applied then the model may be more sensitive to the outliers/extreme values present in some columns as it will try to create a linear relationship that can satisfy both extreme and normal values therefore the regression line will end up somewhere in between the extreme and normal values therefore it's predictions could be inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duplicate Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "If any duplicate rows exist within the dataframe this could become an issue when the algorithm begins to try and map the linear relationship between the inputs and the outputs. This is because by having duplicate rows the system may become bias towards the over duplicates as they appear more often so the algorithm then believes they should be more common, however in reality they may not be. Another issue that arises from having duplicate values is that the model can **overfit** to that specific data entry meaning that the performance metrics - such as `loss` - may be over inflated because for the test data the regression line would be very good at predicting a single combination of inputs' output values however on unseen data it may not perform as well due to over-representation of a single row within the dataset.

Then the `.any(axis=1)` function is applied which conceptually flattens a dataframe into a list by looking at a row - determined by axis = 0 for columns or axis = 1 for rows - of a given index within the dataframe and then if any of the values in that row are `True` then the corresponding index in the created list will be `True` aswell, otherwise the corresponding index is set to `False`. This then means that the `.sum()` function can be applied as it is now operating on a list/array which takes `True = 1` and `False = 0` so by totalling the list it gives us the number of rows that contain `NaN` values."

    "# Explanation\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The large majority of **methods** within the snipped are contained within classes, this is because by encapsulating the methods within a class it can help improve readability and maintainability within the program as I - or anyone else - can easily see the overall operation - loosely shown by the class name - that the method aims to help be executed. Furthermore by containing related methods within classes it allows me to try and stick with the idea that each method/function should only do one thing, so if the methods weren't in classes then it would be a lot harder to figure out which functions call/are related to which other functions whereas classes provide us a way to 'group' similar functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of using classes solely for organisation - although they are typically used to reduce repeated code in a program in python and create objects - means that each function does not have a `self` argument as there is no need due to the only local variable being the dataframe (so an alternative method would be to create an instance of a `outlierHandling()` or `NaNHandling` and then pass in the dataframe that we want the operations to be applied to when the class is instantiated and then the operations could be performed by being called in the `__init__()` function - *this is shown in the first code snipped below* (Note this is isn't the most efficient/best structured approach) - and then returned at the end of the initial function call. In addition another solution could be to create a parent class that inherits the function of both `NaNhandling` and `outlierHandling` which would allow all pre-proccessing to be done in a single class - *shown in the second code snippet below*) which can be simply passed between the required methods. As there is no `self` attribute for either class each method is declared as a `@staticmethod` (this is not explicitly required but is good convention). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 methods that are not contained within classes and this is because there is a very simple amount of code within each of them so there is no need to abstract sections of their code into other functions which could consititute using a class for orgnaisation, these 2 functions are:\n",
    "    - `removeDuplicateRows()`\n",
    "    - `performPreProcessing()`\n",
    "\n",
    "`removeDuplicateRows()` is just a single line that calls the built in pandas function `.drop_duplicates()` whose output is the returned straight away. Then `performPreProcessing()` conceptually acts as a handler as it allows us to call a single function that the 'branches' to 3 other functions which makes the code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Improves Data Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods and classes in the above code snippet help improve data quality through a variety of different ways as explained below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Reduces Overfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "if there are a large number of duplicate values within the dataset then the model will become more and more familiar with them and eventually will learn to predict the exact values of the inputs if the same combination of inputs and output are given multiple times, this means that the model will perform well on its training data as it essentially learns that in this dataset a some combination of inputs is always this output due to being seen multiple times rather than generating general trends based off of the the data - this is more apparent in more complex algorithms such as Neural Networks but still relevant - which is known as `overfitting`. \n",
    "\n",
    "So by removing duplicate rows from the dataset the percentage of unqiue rows in relation to the entire dataset increases which in turn means that the algorithm has to develop and identify more generalised trends rather than learning common values in the dataset, as a result this will improve the accuracy of predictions produced when the algorithm is provided un-seen data to analyse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Prevents Crashing**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original dataset there are a large number of `NaN` values this means that if the data was passed into an algorithm to be analysed then the program would either crash or throw an error and stop running. This could mean that the entire algorithm has to be trained again and although the current application is for linear regression on more complex types of machine learning having to re-train the network could take incredibly large amounts of time especially if the dataset is very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore `NaN` values can create inconsistency within models, because if a model is trained on a dataset that has a large number of `NaN` values and those values are dropped or ignored, then when the same model is applied to a dataset that contains a lot fewer `NaN` values then the predictions/output of the data may be different to what is expected. This is why replacing the `NaN` values with the modal value for that column can be beneficial because instead of just losing the data for that row it maintains it. However this also presents its own issues as the model may receive incosistent data because if any `NaN` value in a column is set to that columns modal value then this could harm the linear relationship between the input attributes which inturn can make it harder for the model to learn. So each method of handling `Nan` values have their respective drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Improves Accuracy**\n",
    "\n",
    "By removing rows that contain far outliers within the dataset it can help the regression model generalise better due to having more consistant data so especially with linear regression models as the algorithms is essentially trying to plot a line of best fit through the dataset if there are outlying pieces of data then the model may end up generating a skewed model as it tries to encompass the outliers as well as the general trend but this typically just results in an regression line that is slightly inaccurate for both typical data and the outliers. Therefore it is beneficial when generating a regression line to remove the outlying data values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** `handleMethod`\n",
    "\n",
    "`handleMethod` provides a way for the programmer to be able to change how certain values are handled allowing a choice between `drop` and `modal`. This parameter decides how whether the program handles `outliers` and `NaN values` are changed within the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "If **drop** is chosen then any rows containing outlying values are dropped from the data set and similarly in `NaNhandling()` if **drop** is selected then rows containing `NaN values` are dropped from the dataset whereas if **modal** is selected then the values are replaced by the modal value of their column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** `upperBound` & `lowerBound`\n",
    "\n",
    "These 2 paramaters are the bounds that values must outside of to constitute outliers. The magnitude of the bounds can be changed by adjust how the scale of the `interquartile range` that is either added (`upperBound`) or subtracted (`lowerBound`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The way these are calculate is by first taking the 1st and 3rd quartile of the dataframe and then assigning those values to `quart1` and `quart3` respectively, then the difference between these is calculated and assigned to `IQrange`, once this value has been calculated it is then scaled (currently by 3x) and subtracted or added to `quart1` and `quart3` respectively to then create the 'threshold' values that constitute the `lowerBound` and `upperBound`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps improve data quality as it removes values that sit far away from the rough/general data pattern, however if the bounds are set too close together then values that are not actually meant to be outliers will be identified as outliers and hence removed from the dataset, this in turn means that the relationship between inputs and output will be very restricted and can cause the algorithm to over fit to the dataset as only values that roughly match a certain relationship will be kept. So as a result the regression line may provide strong performance metrics on the training data however on unseen data (due to not being able to properly generalise the relationship beause of data being restricted effectively to a certain relationship) it could be incredibly inaccurate as the unseen data doesn't specifically match the same trend that the training data did. \n"
