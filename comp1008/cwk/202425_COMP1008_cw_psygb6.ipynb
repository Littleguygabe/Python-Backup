    "# COMP1008 2024/25 Coursework - Wine Quality Prediction with Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Student Name**: Gabriel Bridger\n",
    "#### **Student ID**: 2086810 \n",
    "\n",
    "## Task description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Task**: Utilizing the provided Red Wine Quality dataset, build a Linear Regression Model and another Machine Learning Model of your choice to predict wine quality. Employ appropriate methods from the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn` libraries to analyze and process the dataset for building predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Format**: Use this Jupyter Notebook as a template to write your report in `Markdown` cells, supported by your source code in Code cells. Ensure your code produces the corresponding plots or results addressing the questions. Rename this .ipynb file to `202425_COMP1008_cw_XXX.ipynb`, where XXX is your username (e.g., psxyz), and submit it to Moodle by <b><font color = \"red\">24 March, 3pm</font></b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Marks**: The coursework is worth a total of 100 marks (accounting for 25% of the COMP1008 module grade). Marks will be awarded based on your understanding of machine learning theories, the informativeness and presentation of your code, visualizations, results (e.g., code comments, necessary labels in plots), self-learning ability in solving the specific problem, as well as, how succinct, concise, and clear is your report writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please check the detailed instructions at the end of this template file."
