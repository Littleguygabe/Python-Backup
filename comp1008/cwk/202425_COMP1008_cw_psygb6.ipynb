    "# COMP1008 2024/25 Coursework - Wine Quality Prediction with Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Student Name**: Gabriel Bridger\n",
    "#### **Student ID**: 2086810 \n",
    "\n",
    "## Task description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Task**: Utilizing the provided Red Wine Quality dataset, build a Linear Regression Model and another Machine Learning Model of your choice to predict wine quality. Employ appropriate methods from the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn` libraries to analyze and process the dataset for building predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Format**: Use this Jupyter Notebook as a template to write your report in `Markdown` cells, supported by your source code in Code cells. Ensure your code produces the corresponding plots or results addressing the questions. Rename this .ipynb file to `202425_COMP1008_cw_XXX.ipynb`, where XXX is your username (e.g., psxyz), and submit it to Moodle by <b><font color = \"red\">24 March, 3pm</font></b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Marks**: The coursework is worth a total of 100 marks (accounting for 25% of the COMP1008 module grade). Marks will be awarded based on your understanding of machine learning theories, the informativeness and presentation of your code, visualizations, results (e.g., code comments, necessary labels in plots), self-learning ability in solving the specific problem, as well as, how succinct, concise, and clear is your report writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please check the detailed instructions at the end of this template file."

    "- Use 3 bullet points (one for each characteristics) to present your answer concisely.\n",

    "**Continuous Numerical Values**    \n",
    "The data set has continuous numerical values which allows values to be plotted and analysed to create an equation for the line generated from linear regression techniques. This makes it appropriate because linear regression essentially constructs a line with a linear equation to try and plot a relationship between some given attributes, so the more points and the wider range of points that the algorithm is given the more accurately it will be able to generate a line representing the relationship between the given inputs and the selected output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clear Target Values**    \n",
    "By having a clear target value - 'quality' attribute - it means that the system will be able to calculate a 'loss' value to see how good the generated equation is at predecting the relationship between the set of inputs and the output which means that the algorithm can look at the current loss and previous loss to see if it has decreased and if it has then the algorithm knows for the next iteration aswell to shift the regression line further in that direction so that it isn't blindly guessing which way will improve the accuracy of the predicted relationship.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Likely Linear Relation**\n",
    "Lots of the potential input attributes within the dataset are likely to be linearly related meaning there likely exists a linear equation that can plot the overall relationship between the inputs of the wine data set and the outputs. So a linear regression model will be able to pretty accurately predict the relationship aswell as its aim is to try and establish the linear relationship between attributes"

    "**NaN Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Not A Number` values exist within the data set such as within the `density` or the `free sulfur dioxide` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "If pre-processing isn't applied to remove the `NaN` values from the dataset then this could break the model because if an input is `Not a Number` then the formula (equation of the regression line) cannot be used to predicted the output value of an input which would cause the program to crash.1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers Within the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some values within the dataset have extreme values/outliers - such as in the `chlorides` or `sulphates` columns - which can make it harder for the algorithm to develop a linear regression line for the dataset, so these values will need to be identified and then removed from the data set to avoid harming the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If pre-processing isn't properly applied then the outliers can skew the predicted relationship between the inputs and the outputs resulting in inaccurate predictions for a given set of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not Normally Distributed**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the data for attributes such as `residual sugar` have skewed data distributions and linear regression generally assumes that data is normally distributed across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If pre-processing isn't properly applied then the model may be more sensitive to the outliers/extreme values present in some columns as it will try to create a linear relationship that can satisfy both extreme and normal values therefore the regression line will end up somewhere in between the extreme and normal values therefore it's predictions could be inaccurate.
